    <h2>History of METPALLY DEPOT</h2>


    <p> The <em>Metpally</em> bus depot, part of the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC), operates under the TSRTC, which was formed in <i>2016</i> after <br> 
        <b>Telangana</b> separated from Andhra Pradesh. The TSRTC itself has roots in the <strong>Nizam State Rail & Road Transport established in 1932</strong> . While specific <br> 
        details about the Metpally depot's exact establishment date are not readily available, it's understood to be part of the TSRTC's broader infrastructure.
